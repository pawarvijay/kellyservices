# 1.0.0-rc.1

> 2019-02-04

#### Breaking changes

- The component has been rewritten from scratch to be a display component. All internal state is now gone!
- The `element` prop has changed to `component`
- The styling system was stripped out in favor of a simple `className` prop. Much easier and customizeable.

#### Enhancement

- This is now written in typescript! Types are now available :)

#### Bug fixes

- Any previous styling issues should now be resolved since there is no styling system or default styles.

# Pre 1.0.0-rc.1

Lost to history :(
